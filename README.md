Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I will not be able to serve my notice period as per my contract. As I am currently on bench and not assigned to any project, I would like to request an immediate resignation effective [today's date].

I understand that this may cause inconvenience to the team and the company, and I apologize for any disruption this may cause. I am willing to work with the team and transition my responsibilities to ensure a smooth handover of my work, if there are any pending tasks or responsibilities that I need to fulfill.

Please let me know how I can be of assistance during this transition period. I would be happy to help with any necessary documentation or knowledge transfer.

Thank you for your understanding and support during my time here. I appreciate the opportunities and experiences I have gained while working with this company.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
